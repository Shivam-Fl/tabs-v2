// overriding gates, resetting budgets. Issue and PR comments are attacker-controlled text on
// any repo that accepts outside contributions, so the rules here are deliberately rigid:
//
//   1. A command is only a command at the START of a line. Text that merely mentions
//      "/sdlc approve" inside a sentence, a quote, or a code block is prose.
//   2. Authority comes from the comment's AUTHOR and their association with the repo —
//      never from the comment's content. No string in a comment body can grant permission.
//   3. Unknown commands are rejected, not ignored. Silence looks like success to a caller.
