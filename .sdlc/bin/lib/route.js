// Every issue used to get the whole chain, because the chain was the code. An audit — "scan
// the checkout flow, file what you find, fix nothing" — still spun up a planner and an
// implementer to produce a PR nobody asked for. A one-line typo still bought a three-agent
// plan council. A design question still could not stop after the plan.
//
// Two phases, cheapest first. This file is phase one: deterministic rules, no model, free,
// and it must be *visible* when one fires — a route chosen by script and a route chosen by a
// model are different things and a reader has to be able to tell which happened. What falls
// through goes to a cheap model with the repo's memory in front of it.
//
// Pure functions. The rules decide how much money a ticket costs and whether a human sees it,
// so they are testable without GitHub.
