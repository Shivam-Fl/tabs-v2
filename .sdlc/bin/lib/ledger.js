// merged — and every real loop-back had to be discovered in production and added by hand:
// qa-pass to qa when a rule changed, qa-fail to planning when root-cause was wired, qa-fail to
// review when a rework was re-reviewed. Each addition looked like the last one needed. None
// was. A PR that is still open can take a new commit at any moment, and that puts it back at
// any earlier stage, in any order.
//
// So the working stages are generated as strongly connected, and the guards that actually
// carry weight are the exceptions written underneath:
//
//   - A QA VERDICT may only follow a QA run. qa-pass and qa-fail are not reachable from
//     anywhere else, because "QA passed" recorded from nowhere is the one claim this file
//     exists to make impossible.
//   - MERGED may only follow qa-pass (or a human). Everything else is bookkeeping; this is
//     the state that means code reached the default branch.
//   - Before a PR exists there is no cycle to re-enter: triage and planning stay linear.
