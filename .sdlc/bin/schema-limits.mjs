// A plan council spent twenty minutes producing a work order and the pipeline discarded it
// because one string was 513 characters against a limit of 500. The agent was never told the
// limit existed. Nothing in the pack, nothing in the prompt — the constraint lived only in the
// validator that rejected the result.
//
// A limit nobody is told about is not a constraint, it is a trap. This prints the caps and
// allowed values straight from the schema, so the prompt carries them and they cannot drift
// from what is enforced.
